## Simplified Diagrams

### 1. High-Level Architecture
**Before**: 4 subgraphs, 15 nodes  
**After**: 5 nodes, clear flow  
**Focus**: User → Agent → Specialists → Knowledge → Response

### 2. Agent Execution Flow
**Before**: 12-step sequence diagram  
**After**: 6-step simplified sequence  
**Focus**: Query → Search → Execute → Return

### 3. RAG System
**Before**: 4 subgraphs with detailed connections  
**After**: Simple decision flow with fallback  
**Focus**: Search KB → Found? → Yes/No → Result

### 4. Clean Architecture
**Before**: 13 components in 4 layers  
**After**: 3 simple layers, bottom-up  
**Focus**: Domain → Application → Infrastructure

### 5. Specialist Execution
**Before**: 8-state machine with notes  
**After**: 5-step linear process  
**Focus**: Receive → Search → Execute → Format → Return

### 6. Agent Workflow
**Before**: 7 states with conditional paths  
**After**: 4 states linear  
**Focus**: Analyze → Select → Execute → Generate

### 7. Tool Selection
**Before**: 20+ nodes decision tree  
**After**: 5 intent categories  
**Focus**: Intent → Appropriate specialist

### 8. Conversation Memory
**Before**: 8-step sequence with storage  
**After**: 6-step linear flow  
**Focus**: Query 1 → Store → Query 2 → Context

### 9. 7 Specialists Summary
**New**: Visual overview of all specialists  
**Focus**: Agent → 7 colored specialists with descriptions

### 10. Databricks Deployment
**Before**: 13 components across 4 environments  
**After**: 5-step deployment flow  
**Focus**: Package → Cluster → Agent → Claude → Workflows

### 11. Error Handling
**Before**: 11-step complex flowchart  
**After**: Simple decision: RAG or fallback  
**Focus**: Try RAG → Success/Fail → Enhanced/Fallback

## Removed Diagrams

**Component Interaction Matrix** - Moved to table format instead of diagram

---

## Color Coding Applied

All diagrams now use consistent colors:
- **Blue (#aff)**: Knowledge/Storage
- **Yellow (#ffa)**: Processing/Logic
- **Pink (#faf)**: Specialists
- **Green (#afa)**: Success/Complete
- **Red (#faa)**: Error/Fallback
