## Cleanup Results

### Emojis Removed (359 total)
All decorative emojis removed from headings and content:
- ❌ Removed: 🤖, 🎯, 📦, 🔑, ⚠️, ✅, 📊, 🔧, 📚, 🚀, 💡, ⚙, ✨, 🧠, 📘, 🎮
- ✅ Professional: No emojis in any documentation

### Unicode Symbols Preserved (30 occurrences)
Technical symbols kept for professional documentation:
- ✅ `→` (arrow): Used for workflow diagrams and navigation
- ✅ `←` (left arrow): Used for dependency diagrams
- ✅ `↓` (down arrow): Used for architecture layers
- ✅ `•` (bullet): Used for list formatting
- ✅ `✗` (x-mark): Used for error states in code examples

**Rationale:** These Unicode symbols are standard in professional technical documentation (e.g., AWS, Microsoft, Google Cloud docs).
