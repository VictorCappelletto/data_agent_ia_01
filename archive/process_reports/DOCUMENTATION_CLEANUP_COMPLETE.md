## Remaining Considerations

### Not Changed (Intentionally)
- `docs/` - MkDocs content (separate cleanup)
- `examples/` - Already cleaned
- `tests/` - Already cleaned
- `data_pipeline_agent_lib/` - Core code (already refactored)

### Future Maintenance
- Keep root docs minimal (5 files)
- Archive process reports immediately
- Consolidate before adding new docs
- Review quarterly for drift
