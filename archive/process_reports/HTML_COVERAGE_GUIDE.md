## 📈 Coverage Interpretation

### By Percentage

| Coverage | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **90-100%** | Excellent | Maintain, maybe minor edge cases |
| **70-89%** | Good | Add tests for critical paths |
| **50-69%** | Acceptable | Consider more tests for core logic |
| **< 50%** | Low | Needs E2E or integration tests |

### By Module Type

| Module Type | Current | Target | Reason |
|-------------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Specialists** | 91% | 90%+ | ✅ Achieved - Core logic |
| **Utils** | 82% | 80%+ | ✅ Achieved - Support code |
| **Domain Ports** | 100% | 100% | ✅ Achieved - Interfaces |
| **Agent Core** | 11% | 70%+ | 🎯 Needs E2E tests |
| **Infrastructure** | 23% | 60%+ | 🎯 Needs E2E tests |

## 🎓 Reading the Report: Examples

### Example 1: High Coverage File

**Open:** `specialists/bug_resolver.py`

**You'll see:**
```python
1: 🟢 from typing import Dict, List, Optional
2: 🟢 from langchain.tools import tool
3: 🟢 from ..utils import get_logger, ResponseFormatter
...
15: 🟢 def resolve_hdl_bug(error_description: str) -> str:
16: 🟢     """Resolve DPL bugs."""
17: 🟢     logger.info("Resolving DPL bug")
18: 🟢     bug_type = _identify_bug_type(error_description)
...
```

**All green = 100% coverage!** ✅

### Example 2: Low Coverage File

**Open:** `agent/graph.py`

**You'll see:**
```python
1: 🟢 from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
2: 🟢 from .nodes import analyze_intent_node
3: 🟢 from .state import AgentState
...
50: 🔴 def route_after_intent(state: AgentState) -> str:
51: 🔴     """Route based on intent analysis."""
52: 🔴     intent = state.get("intent", "unknown")
53: 🔴     if intent == "troubleshooting":
54: 🔴         return "retrieve_knowledge"
...
```

**Red lines = not covered by unit tests** ⚠️  
**Why:** Requires full LangGraph execution (E2E tests)

## 🚀 Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: "Which specialists need more tests?"
1. Open `index.html`
2. Find `specialists/` modules
3. Look at coverage %:
   - bug_resolver.py: 100% ✅
   - performance_advisor.py: 100% ✅
   - troubleshooter.py: 79% ⚠️
4. Click `troubleshooter.py` to see red lines
5. Add tests for uncovered functions

### Use Case 2: "Why is agent/graph.py only 23%?"
1. Click `agent/graph.py` in index
2. See lots of red in:
   - `route_after_intent()`
   - `route_after_retrieval()`
   - `create_data_pipeline_agent_graph()`
3. **Reason:** LangGraph workflow not executed
4. **Solution:** E2E tests with API key

### Use Case 3: "What's covered in utils?"
1. Find `utils/response_formatter.py` (94%)
2. Click to see details
3. Most lines green ✅
4. Few red lines = edge cases
5. Decide if edge cases matter
